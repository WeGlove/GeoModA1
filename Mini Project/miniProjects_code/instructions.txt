Please run the examples, 
look at the code to get familiar with how meshes are handled.
The example codes will help you throughout your project.

Available functions allow computing
-loading and plotting triangle meshes
-rotate-zoom, pan on 3d meshes with the mouse
-plotting quadrilateral meshes (usfeul for subdivision)
-computing Laplacian matrix of a mesh.
-Boundary loops
-picking vertices with the mouse on 3D meshes (without the annoying data tip)
-the file useful matrices contains some usefull tricks. 

Good luck
